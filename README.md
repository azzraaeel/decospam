To use this script, you need to obtain your authorization token:
1. Go to the target site and, while in the send message UI, press F12.

</p>
2. Navigate to the Network tab and monitor network activity.
3. Send any message, and you will see something like this.
<p align="left">
  <img src="screenshot2.png" alt="Alt text" width="400" />
</p>
4. This is how you can obtain your auth token, which you should then enter into the script.
